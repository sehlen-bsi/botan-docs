**Summary**

The objective of this project is the secure implementation of a universal crypto
library which contains all common cryptographic primitives that are necessary for
the wide use of cryptographic operations. These include symmetric and asymmetric
encryption and signature methods, PRFs, hash functions and RNGs. Additionally,
security standards such as X.509 and SSL/TLS have to be supported. The library will
be provided to manufacturers of VS-NfD products which will help the Federal Office
for Information Security (BSI) to evaluate these products.

This document reports the test results of the Botan test suite.

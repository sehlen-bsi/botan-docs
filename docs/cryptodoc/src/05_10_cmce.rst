Algorithm Internals
-------------------

The implementation of Classic McEliece is organized based on the algorithm's
operations and structures. Table :ref:`Classic McEliece components
<pubkey/cmce/component_table>` shows an overview of the components and
their corresponding file locations. Classic McEliece, like all Key Encapsulation
Mechanisms (KEMs), consists of three main algorithms: Key generation, key
encapsulation, and key decapsulation. In the case of Classic McEliece, the key
generation process involves creating a field ordering and an irreducible
polynomial. These two components define the randomly chosen Goppa code, the
secret information stored in the private key. A parity check matrix in
systematic form is derived from the Goppa code to generate the public key used
for encapsulation. More detailed information about these processes can be found
in the following sections.

.. _pubkey/cmce/types:

Types
^^^^^

In implementing Botan's Classic McEliece, strong types are utilized to
ensure the correct data usage within the code. These strong types are
fundamental to separate the domain of the various byte sequences involved in
Classic McEliece, such as multiple types of seeds, random byte sequences for different
algorithms, and bit-vectors with different semantic contexts. Specific integers,
like raw Galois Field elements and their modulus, are
also represented as strong types. This reliance on strong types is similar to using them
in :ref:`SPHINCS+ <signatures/sphincsplus/types>` for
similar reasons. The Classic McEliece implementation enhances readability,
clarity, and reliability by employing strong types.


..  _pubkey/cmce/gf:

Galois Field Arithmetic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Goppa code is based on the Galois field (GF) :math:`\mathbb{F}_{q}`, where :math:`q=2^m`.
To represent GF elements, we utilize the class ``Classic_McEliece_GF``. Each
element is defined by two polynomials: one defines its value, and the other
defines the modulus of the field. These values are represented as unsigned
integers. For example, the element :math:`z^3+z+1` is represented by the unsigned
integer ``0b1011``.

The GF elements support various operations such as addition, multiplication,
and inversion. These operations are implemented in constant time for operands
within the same field. Multiplication is performed using a constant-time
schoolbook multiplication algorithm with a consecutive constant-time reduction.
Inversion is achieved using Fermat's little theorem: :math:`a^{-1} = a^{q-2}`.
For that, exponentiation is implemented using a simple square-and-multiply
algorithm. It is worth noting that square-and-multiply has no timing
side-channel vulnerabilities since the exponent remains constant for each field.

.. _pubkey/cmce/field_ordering:

Field Ordering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Section 8.2 of [CMCE-ISO]_ defines the field ordering as a permutation
of elements in the Galois field :math:`\mathbb{F}_{q}`. This ordering is
required for generating a random sequence :math:`\alpha_0,...,\alpha_{n-1}` of distinct
:math:`\mathbb{F}_{q}` elements, which is necessary for creating the Goppa
code. Botan's ``Classic_McEliece_Field_Ordering`` serves as a container for the
field ordering and includes the algorithm to generate it. To sort the pairs
:math:`(a_i, i)` (as described in Step 3 of Section 8.2 in [CMCE-ISO]_), a
constant-time bitonic sort implementation is utilized. This sorting algorithm is
particularly suitable for sets with a power of two elements.

Another vital role of the field ordering class is managing the Bene≈° network.
As Section 9.2.10 of [CMCE-ISO]_ outlines, the Bene≈° network stores the field
ordering as control bits in a compact form. Botan employs
a constant-time implementation of the ``controlbits`` algorithm presented in
Fig. 7.1 of [CBits]_ to create control bits, and the ``permutation`` algorithm
to reconstruct the field ordering from the control bits. The creation
algorithm also utilizes constant-time bitonic sorting.


.. _pubkey/cmce/poly:

Polynomial Arithmetic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Classic McEliece algorithm uses elements in the polynomial ring
:math:`\mathbb{F}_q [y]` in multiple places. The monic irreducible
polynomial defines the Goppa code, and performing decapsulation requires an
error locator polynomial. Botan's ``Classic_McEliece_Poly`` class is designed
to represent these polynomials. It consists of a vector of GF elements, which
serve as the polynomial coefficients. Additionally, this class provides
the necessary logic to evaluate the polynomial at a given point in
:math:`\mathbb{F}_q`.

Polynomial arithmetic is required to obtain the monic irreducible polynomial
:math:`g` from a random element :math:`\beta \in \mathbb{F}_{q} [y]/F(y)`, as
described in Step 3 of Section 8.1 in [CMCE-ISO]_. This arithmetic
is implemented in the ``Classic_McEliece_Polynomial_Ring`` class, representing
the polynomial ring :math:`\mathbb{F}_{q} [y]/F(y)` and supporting the
multiplication of two polynomials.

Following the recommendation in the implementors' guide Section 6.1 that
accompanies [CMCE-R4]_, the minimal polynomial is computed by finding a unique
solution to the equation :math:`g_0\beta^0 + ... + g_{t-1}\beta^{t-1} = \beta^t`.
A constant-time Gauss elimination algorithm is used to solve this equation.
The algorithm aborts if the solution is non-unique. The minimal polynomial
is then represented as a ``Classic_McEliece_Minimal_Polynomial`` object, which
includes logic for serialization and deserialization as described in
Section 9.2.9 of [CMCE-ISO]_.


.. _pubkey/cmce/bitvector:

Bit Vector Arithmetic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Botan's ``bitvector`` class is a versatile tool for working with bits.
One such application is the Classic McEliece algorithm, where it handles
binary matrices, error vectors, code words, and the column selections in the private
key. The ``bitvector`` class provides a range of useful methods for these tasks.

A ``bitvector`` can be dynamically initialized with any length. It can be created
from a vector of bytes and serialized back to it, as described in Section 9.2.1
of [CMCE-ISO]_. The class allows for adding or removing bits, accessing and
manipulating individual bits, and obtaining specific properties of the vector,
such as the Hamming weight or checking if the vector is all-zero. Sub-vectors
can also be extracted from an existing ``bitvector``.

Furthermore, the ``bitvector`` class supports binary operations between two vectors
of the same length, including AND, OR, and XOR. These operations are optimized
for performance, especially in the context of Classic McEliece.

The design of the ``bitvector`` class prioritizes constant times, particularly
for Classic McEliece. The time taken for bit accesses and manipulations depends
only on the bit's position, not its value. Operations between two vectors
are also constant-time when the operands have the same length. The timing of
helper functions, such as the Hamming weight, is also implemented with
constant time in mind.


.. _pubkey/cmce/matrix:

Matrix Operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Classic McEliece's key generation algorithm utilizes its Goppa code, defined by a
field ordering and a monic irreducible polynomial, to create a binary parity
check matrix :math:`H` in systematic form. This matrix is represented by the
``Classic_McEliece_Matrix`` class.

The class follows the process outlined in Section 7.2 of [CMCE-ISO]_ for matrix
creation. Initially, a binary :math:`mt \times n` matrix is created as
described in Steps 1 and 2 of Section 7.2.2. Each row of the matrix is
represented as a ``bitvector`` object. Subsequently, a constant-time Gauss
algorithm is applied to reduce the matrix to the systematic form :math:`H=(I_{mt}|T)`.
The algorithm achieves this by systematically applying XOR operations on pairs
of matrix rows, resulting in the identity matrix on the left. Finally, the
submatrix `T` is stored in the matrix object, mirroring its representation in
the public key specified in Section 9.2.7 of [CMCE-ISO]_.

Classic McEliece instances with the suffix ``f`` employ a semi-systematic transformation
strategy, utilizing the parameters :math:`(\mu, \nu) = (32, 64)`, as described
in Section 7.2.3 of [CMCE-ISO]_. Following the recommendation in Section 6.1 of
the implementation guide accompanying [CMCE-R4]_, a Gauss algorithm is executed
to create an identity matrix for the first :math:`mt-\mu` rows. Subsequently, a
modified Gauss algorithm achieves a reduced row-echelon form for
the :math:`\mu \times \nu` submatrix at position :math:`(\mu, \mu)`.
This process determines the column selection, i.e., the indices of the non-zero
columns. As Section 7.2.3 Step 5 of [CMCE-ISO]_ outlines, the matrix's
columns and the field ordering are permuted according to the pivots. The main
Gauss algorithm concludes at this point, leaving the matrix in its modified
and systematic form.

For encapsulation, the matrix :math:`H` is multiplied by an error vector
:math:`e`. This multiplication is performed by computing the parity of the
Hamming weight of :math:`e\ \textrm{XOR}\ r` for each row :math:`r` of :math:`H`.
Matrix creation and multiplication are implemented in constant time for matrices
with fixed dimensions.


.. _pubkey/cmce/keys_internal:

Key Pair
^^^^^^^^

Botan's key pair for Classic McEliece consists of two classes:
``Classic_McEliece_PrivateKeyInternal`` and ``Classic_McEliece_PublicKeyInternal``.
As defined in Section 9.2.12, the private key stores the key generation seed,
column selection, monic irreducible polynomial, field ordering control bits,
and the seed for implicit rejection. On the other hand, the public key
contains the sub-matrix :math:`T` of the binary parity check matrix
:math:`H = (I_{mt}|T)`.

The class ``Classic_McEliece_KeyPair_Internal`` holds both the private and public
keys and contains key generation method. Details are discussed in Section
:ref:`Key Generation <pubkey/cmce/key_gen>`.


.. _pubkey/cmce/encaps_internal:

Encapsulation Internals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The class ``Classic_McEliece_Encryptor`` implements Botan's key
encapsulation interface. Performing encapsulation requires two building blocks:
Fixed weight vector creation and error vector encoding.

The algorithm described in Section 8.4 of [CMCE-ISO]_ is followed to create a
fixed weight error vector. Random elements :math:`d_0,...,d_{\tau-1}` are
generated, where the first :math:`t` elements smaller than :math:`n` are selected as
:math:`a_0,...,a_{t-1}`. It is important to note that selecting
:math:`d_i` elements for :math:`a_j` elements may leak through timing
side-channels. However, the content of these elements remains undisclosed,
preventing attackers from gaining helpful information from this side channel.

Next, all possible pairs are compared to ensure that all elements of
:math:`a_0,...,a_{t-1}` are distinct. Finally, a binary error vector :math:`e`
is created with set bits at the locations of :math:`a_0,...,a_{t-1}`. This
creation process also considers constant times.

For encoding, the parity check matrix :math:`H` is multiplied with :math:`e` as
Section :ref:`Matrix Operations <pubkey/cmce/matrix>` describes. The
encapsulation algorithm used in Botan is outlined in Section
:ref:`Key Encapsulation <pubkey/cmce/encapsulation>`.


.. _pubkey/cmce/decaps_internal:

Decapsulation Internals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The class ``Classic_McEliece_Decryptor`` in Botan is responsible for
key decapsulation. One of the crucial steps in the decapsulation algorithm of
Classic McEliece is the decoding subroutine described in Section 7.4 of
[CMCE-ISO]_. This subroutine is implemented based on the recommendations
provided in [McBits]_. The decoding process utilizes Berlekamp's algorithm for
Goppa decoding.

To begin with, the code word :math:`C` that needs to be decoded is extended by
appending zeros. This results in a binary vector :math:`\nu = (C,0,\dots,0) \in \mathbb{F}_2^{n}`,
as Section 7.2 Step 1 of [CMCE-ISO]_ defines. Subsequently, the syndrome for
Berlekamp's method is computed from :math:`\nu`. The syndrome is a vector given by
:math:`\left( \sum\nolimits_{i} \frac{\nu_i\alpha_i^0}{g(\alpha_i)^2},\dots,\sum\nolimits_{i} \frac{\nu_i\alpha_i^{n-1}}{g(\alpha_i)^2} \right)`,
where :math:`\alpha_i` are the first :math:`n` field ordering elements and
:math:`g` is the Goppa polynomial.

Next, the error locator polynomial :math:`\sigma` is computed using the
Berlekamp-Massey algorithm on the syndrome. The resulting polynomial has a
particular property concerning the error vector :math:`e` we search for.
Specifically, :math:`\sigma(\alpha_i) = 0` if and only if
:math:`e_i = 1`. By evaluating :math:`\sigma` at :math:`\alpha_0,\dots,\alpha_{n-1}`,
we can reconstruct the error vector :math:`e`.

To ensure accurate decoding, Botan follows the recommendation in Section 6.3 of
the implementation guide of [CMCE-R4]_. It computes the syndrome for the error
vector :math:`e` and compares it with the syndrome for :math:`\nu`. If the
comparison holds and the weight of :math:`e` is equal to :math:`t`, we consider
the decoding successful. Otherwise, it is flagged as a failure.

It is worth noting that the syndrome computation, Berlekamp-Massey algorithm, and
locator polynomial evaluation are implemented in constant time. Additionally,
the checks for the weight of :math:`e` and the syndrome comparison are designed
to avoid early abortion if any check fails.


.. _pubkey/cmce/params:

Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^

The ``Classic_McEliece_Parameter_Set`` enum contains all instances of the
Classic McEliece algorithm listed in Table :ref:`Supported Classic McEliece
Parameter Sets <pubkey/cmce/parameter_table>`. These parameter sets serve as
the basis for deriving all the necessary parameters used within the algorithm.
They are collected in a ``Classic_McElice_Parameters`` object, which includes
all the parameters defined in the specifications [CMCE-ISO]_ and [CMCE-R4]_.
This object is passed to all algorithm components, ensuring consistent
parameter usage.


.. _pubkey/cmce/key_gen:


Key Generation
--------------

Classic McEliece key generation follows Section 8.3 of [CMCE-ISO]_ and is
implemented within the ``Classic_McEliece_KeyPair_Internal`` class. It works as
follows:

.. admonition:: Classic McEliece Key Generation

   **Input:**

   -  ``rng``: random number generator

   **Output:**

   -  ``SK``, ``PK``: private and public key

   **Steps:**

   1. Generate a random value ``seed`` using ``rng``
   2. ``s, ordering_bits, irreducible_bits, next_seed = PRF(seed)``
   3. | Create a field ordering ``field_ordering`` using ``ordering_bits``
      | On failure, set ``seed = next_seed`` and go to step 2

   4. | Create a monic irreducible polynomial ``g`` using ``irreducible_bits``
      | On failure, set ``seed = next_seed`` and go to step 2

   5. | Create a parity check matrix in systematic form ``H = (I_mt | T)`` using ``field_ordering`` and ``g``. Meanwhile, compute the column selection ``c``
      | On failure, set ``seed = next_seed`` and go to step 2

   6. ``SK = {seed, c, g, field_ordering, s}, PK = {T}``

   **Notes:**

   - ``PRG`` is an application of ``SHAKE256`` with an input prefix byte 64.
     The output length is ``n/8 + 4q + 2t + 32`` bytes. It is defined
     in Section 9.1 of [CMCE-ISO]_.
   - Only the first ``n`` elements of the field ordering are used to
     create the parity check matrix.
   - For instances with the suffix ``f``, the semi-systematic transformation
     strategy is employed. In this case, ``field_ordering`` is updated to
     reflect the column selection.
   - To store the private and public keys as bytes, the respective entries are
     serialized following the specifications of Section 9.2 of [CMCE-ISO]_.


.. _pubkey/cmce/encapsulation:

Key Encapsulation
-----------------

The Classic McEliece encapsulation procedure of Botan follows Section 8.5 of
[CMCE-ISO]_ and works as follows:

.. admonition:: Classic McEliece Encapsulation

   **Input:**

   - ``PK = {T}``: public key
   - ``rng``: random number generator

   **Output:**

   - ``encap_key``: ciphertext of shared key
   - ``shared_key``: plaintext shared key

   **Steps:**

   1. Generate a random error vector ``e`` of weight ``t`` using ``rng``
   2.  ``c0 = (I_mt | T) * e`` to encode ``e``
   3. Depending on whether the parameter set includes plaintext confirmation (suffix ``pc``):

       a. **Without pc:** ``encap_key = c0``
       b. **With pc:** ``c1 = Hash(2, e)``, ``encap_key = c0 || c1``

   4.  ``shared_key = Hash(1, e, encap_key)``

   **Notes:**

   - ``Hash`` is an application of ``SHAKE256`` with 32 output bytes as defined
     in Section 9.1 of [CMCE-ISO]_.


.. _pubkey/cmce/decapsulation:

Key Decapsulation
-----------------

The Classic McEliece decapsulation procedure of Botan follows Section 8.6 of
[CMCE-ISO]_ and works as follows:

.. admonition:: Classic McEliece Decapsulation

   **Input:**

   -  ``SK = {seed, c, g, field_ordering, s}``: secret key
   -  ``encap_key``: encapsulated key bytes

   **Output:**

   -  ``shared_key``: shared key

   **Steps:**

   1. Depending on whether the parameter set includes plaintext confirmation (suffix ``pc``):

       a. **Without pc:** ``c0 = encap_key``
       b. **With pc:** ``c0, c1 = encap_key``, split after ``ceil(m*t/8)`` bytes

   2. | Decode ``c0`` to obtain ``e`` using Berlekamp's algorithm and set ``b = 1``
      | On failure set ``e = s`` and ``b = 0``

   3. | **Only for pc instances:** ``c1_p = Hash(2, e)``
      | If ``c1_p != c1`` set ``e = s`` and ``b = 0``

   4. ``shared_key = Hash(b, e, encap_key)``

   **Notes:**

   - ``Hash`` is an application of ``SHAKE256`` with 32 output bytes as defined
     in Section 9.1 of [CMCE-ISO]_.
   - The assignments of ``e`` and ``b`` in steps 2 and 3 are implemented using
     Botan's constant-time helper functions to ensure constant-time execution.

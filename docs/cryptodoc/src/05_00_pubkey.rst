Public Key Algorithms
=====================

This chapter outlines the relevant public key algorithms offered by Botan. Both
classical and quantum-secure algorithms are available. Depending on the concrete
algorithm the sub-chapters look at parameter generation, key generation,
signature generation and verification, asymmetric encryption and decryption, key
encapsulation and decapsulation or the key exchange mechanism.

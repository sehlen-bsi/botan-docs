title: NIST PQC Algorithms

description: |
  With the NIST's final standardization of the post-quantum secure algorithms,
  the existing algorithms are adapted accordingly to match the differences
  between the submitted and the final versions.

# FIX: SLH-DSA should default to 'Hedged' variant

  comment: |
    FIPS 205 mandates that the SLH-DSA variant should default to the 'Hedged'
    variant. Initially this default was not implemented (Botan 3.6.0).

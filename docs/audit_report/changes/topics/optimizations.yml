  comment: |
    Optimizes the CRT-based RSA decryption algorithm to use in between values in
    Montgomery form using new classes for handling Montgomery transformed
    integers. The new implementation only works in combination with the
    CRT-based approach for balanced primes (bits of p = bits of q). Unbalanced
    primes are supported using a slower non-CRT approach (also constant time).

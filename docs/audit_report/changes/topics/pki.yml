    This slightly simplifies the implementation of key exchange protocols that
    depend on ephemeral keys (e.g. when using a DH-style algorithm as a KEM).

# FIX: Non-KEX-algos may choose to not implement ::generate_another()  (@reneme)

    Previously, ``EC_PrivateKey::check_key()`` only checked that the associated
    public point is on the respective curve. Now it additionally checks that the
    private value is between 1 and the curve order.

    ... useful for stateful signature algorithms like XMSS or LMS.

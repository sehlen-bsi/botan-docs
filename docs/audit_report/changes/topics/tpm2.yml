title: Trusted Platform Module 2 (TPM2)

description: |
  The patches in this section introduce TPM2 support in Botan. Keys that
  reside in a TPM2 can be used in Botan for RSA signing/verifying and
  encrypting/decrypting as well as for ECDSA signing/verifying. Keys can
  also be created and managed. Communication with the TPM can
  be established via sessions with a trusted TPM key. The TPM can also
  serve as a Botan RNG source.

  These changes rely on utilizing the `tpm2-tss` library for TPM commands.
  Since this library by default uses OpenSSL for the client-side crypto,
  the patches provide a crypto backend that instead uses only Botan.

    This PR introduces TPM2 support in the form of RNG, RSA functionalities,
    and key management. Sessions are also only supported with RSA keys.
    A crypto backend is introduced for the client-side crypto.

description: |
  Kuznyechik (Russian: literally "grasshopper") is a block cipher
  defined in the National Standard of the Russian Federation GOST R 34.12-2015.
  It was discovered that its supposedly random S-boxes feature a mathematical
  structure that is unlikely to have occured by chance [BirPerUdo16]_. It was accepted into
  Botan because VeraCrypt supports it as an alternative cipher.

  The BSI build policy prohibits the inclusion of Kuznyechik and no parts of it
  will be compiled into the library's binary files.

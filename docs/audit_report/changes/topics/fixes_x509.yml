title: Fixes in X.509

description: |
  Due to some discovered issues with X.509 certificate handling, several fixes
  and refactorings were applied to the X.509 module.

  Please see :ref:`chapter/vulnerabilities` for more details on the fixed
  vulnerabilities.

    Refactors the internal interface of AlternativeName. Also resolves a
    performance issue in the name constraint matching code.

# Fix X509_CRL::crl_issuing_distribution_point  (@randombit)
- pr: 4030  # https://github.com/randombit/botan/pull/4030
  merge_commit: 44147d5f6d3cc8a56d040ad729fc7bf217a04019

    Refactor the internal representation of issuing distribution points in
    Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).

# During X509 path validation, return immediately if a signature is invalid  (@randombit)
- pr: 4045  # https://github.com/randombit/botan/pull/4045
  merge_commit: 39535f13c322f56aa3da2f44b2b6abb8619a82ac

    Changes the X509 path validation logic to return early if the certificate
    chain cannot be trusted. Used to make denial-of-service-like attacks
    more difficult.

    Hardens the checks on Server Name Indication (SNI) handling in TLS so that
    IP addresses are prohibited.

    The following issues were addressed:

    * X.509 Alternative Name addresses with not exactly 4 (IPv4) or 16 bytes \
      (IPv6) were not rejected.

    * Malformed key usage extensions were effectively ignored. Now, they \
      result in an empty extension that prohibits all key usages.

    * In addition to the key usage extension, the extended key usage extension  \
      is now also checked to see if a CA is allowed to sign.

    * Permitted subtrees in X.509 name constraints were not handled correctly. \
      Botan required a constraint for all names to match. Instead, every \
      name must match any permitted subtree.

    * Malformed server alternative names are now handled as empty ones to prevent \
      a fallback to the common name when checking the domain name.

    * Refactoring of name constraint logic.

    * Various tests were updated and fixed. Support for an external X.509 \
      test suite was included.

title: Constant Time Validation Helpers

description: |
  This topic covers changes related to Botan's constant time helpers.
  Most notably, the infrastructure for Valgrind checks has been
  improved. The latest implementations have been updated to incorporate
  Valgrind's constant-time checks.

patches:
# Add CT::Option  (@randombit)
- pr: 4175  # https://github.com/randombit/botan/pull/4175
  merge_commit: e280c77f7aaa0f363460464fcee194a99daa3f7c
  classification: critical

    Add CT::Option, a helper class similar to std::optional
    that can contain a value or none. In contrast to std::optional,
    CT::Option is designed to be used in constant time contexts.

title: Classic McEliece

description: |
  Botan 3.7.1 contains the implementation of the Classic McEliece KEM algorithm
  based on the contribution to NIST's round 4 PQC competition and the
  corresponding ISO draft. The main pull request for this feature was
  supplemented by some minor refactorings and improvements.

    Works around a false positive of valgrind in the Classic McEliece
    implementation. Also adds a valgrind self-test for this type of
    issue.

    Contains some minor refactorings in the Classic McEliece code. This is
    related to code style and modernization without changing any critical
    logic.

title: Removals

description: |
  The library regularly sheds old algorithms or public APIs. Typically things
  are deprecated first and removed in a future major release (Botan4 ETA 2027).
  This way, support guarantees along the lines of "semantic versioning" can be
  provided.

  Exceptionally, this release actually removes functionality that was
  retrospectively declared as "experimental". Namely, the ability to perform TLS
  1.3 handshakes using a pre-standardized version of Kyber. Note that this does
  not remove the deprecated pre-standard implementation of Kyber but just its
  usage within TLS.

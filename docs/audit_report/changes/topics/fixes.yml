  comment: |
    This fixes the handling of cipher modes that require the entire message to
    be available before encryption/decryption can begin. Before, the input
    buffer was inadvertently copied into the output buffer, which is generally
    considered to contain encrypted data. Note that this is an issue when used
    via the Foreign Function Interface, only.

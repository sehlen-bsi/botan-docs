title: Fixes

description: |
  This contains various fixes to the library itself or auxiliary infrastructure.
  Some are relevant to security, but none are critical enough to constituate a
  vulnerability. Explicitly note the two fixes related to potential side-channel
  mitigations in the handling of PKCS #1 v1.5 RSA paddings.

    Applications using this function to avoid oracles against PKCS #1 v1.5 could
    inadvertantly create an oracle themselves if they re-checked the content of
    the decryption result, because the random buffer returned for a decryption
    failure didn't adhere to the content specifications provided by the
    application. Note that usage of PKCS #1 v1.5 is strongly discouraged anyway.

    ML-DSA verification in itself was fine, there was a discrepancy though,
    whether or not to accept signatures where the hint-bits revealed too much
    information about the private key.

    The underlying side channel is introduced by the TPM 2.0 specification
    unfortunately. This merely tries to avoid amplifying the signal produced by
    it. Note that usage of PKCS #1 v1.5 is strongly discouraged anyway.

    This now validates and canonicalizes URIs noted in "alternative name"
    extensions. Also, certificates with an empty "extended key usage" extension
    are rejected as their key wouldn't be allowed to be used for anything, as
    per RFC 5280 Section 4.2.1.12.

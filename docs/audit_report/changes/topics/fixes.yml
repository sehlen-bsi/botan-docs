# Correct an error in RFC 6979 ECDSA  (@randombit)
- pr: 4040  # https://github.com/randombit/botan/pull/4040

    Fixes a bug where the ECDSA message hash was not reduced modulo the EC group order
    before being used in the signature computation. Due to the math involved, this
    does not produce wrong results, but RFC 6979 asks for it. Also, this fix now
    disallows ECDSA private keys that were not reduced beforehand. The tests were
    adjusted accordingly.


# fixed retransmission handled ClientHello with another protocol version.  (@volok-aleksej)

    Fixes a DTLS 1.2 bug that terminates a connection if ClientHello records
    are retransmitted.

# PBES2 improvements and fix PBES2-related scrypt bug  (@randombit)
- pr: 4118  # https://github.com/randombit/botan/pull/4118
  merge_commit: f02c6027b19f3e992796c157a474720ed3bcf82a

  comment: |
    The automatic parameter tuning for scrypt2 might have yielded a smaller
    memory consumption factor than intended. Also, include the key length in the
    PBES2 container encoding only if the used cipher does not define it.

    The fix addresses a performance regression on some platforms. Most notably,
    when running argon2 with a configuration that uses only a single thread, Botan
    would have unneccessarily spun up a thread pool. On some platforms this is
    problematic. Also, it entirely disables the thread pool by default on WASM.

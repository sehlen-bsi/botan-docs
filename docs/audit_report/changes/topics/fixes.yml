    The fix addresses a performance regression on some platforms. Most notably,
    when running argon2 with a configuration that uses only a single thread, Botan
    would have unneccessarily spun up a thread pool. On some platforms this is
    problematic. Also, it entirely disables the thread pool by default on WASM.

# FFI: Loading of raw FrodoKEM keys & FIX: "insufficient buffer handling" in FFI's decapsulate

  comment: |
    When passing an insufficiently sized buffer into the FFI's decapsulate function,
    the function would return a 'success' code instead of a 'buffer too small' error
    code. The actual buffer handling was correct, just the return code was wrong.

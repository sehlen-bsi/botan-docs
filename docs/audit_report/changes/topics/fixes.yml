    Adds checks that ensure Argon2 output and parameters stay within specified
    bounds, i.e. less than 2^32.

# Initialize stack array b in generate_prime  (@Jack Lloyd)
- commit: bd251b7669dda9f0977f2386c56d2748767a6d0c  # https://github.com/randombit/botan/commit/bd251b7669dda9f0977f2386c56d2748767a6d0c

    OSS-Fuzz found a potential read of uninitialized array data holding random
    bytes. In normal operation, this array is filled with random bytes right
    after creation. This is an additional safety precation but doesn't have any
    practical relevance when assuming nominal operation of the RNG.

    This fixes potential use-after-free and/or null pointer dereferences in case
    an asymmetric key operation outlived its underlying asymmetric key object.

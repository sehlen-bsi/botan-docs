    Introduces a helper for a 3-word wide accumulator that is useful for
    comba multiplication and big number montgomery reduction.

    Introduces a rough check for the Hasse bound to the curve verification.
    The replaced bogus curve was just in some example code and not used in the library.

    This restricts application-defined elliptic curves:

    * must be prime order.
    * must have a cofactor of 1.
    * prime bitlength must be between 128 and 512 bits
      (with special allowance for 521-bit Mersenne prime)
    * prime must be congruent to 3 mod 4.

    This is a re-implementation of prime-order elliptic using modern
    C++ features to allow significantly better compiler optimizations
    and have a much better side-channel profile.

    This fixes an issue that was introduced recently and was never
    part of an official release.

title: Random Number Generator

description: |
  On older versions of glibc (< 2.25) ``getrandom()`` is not available. Though,
  this is just a wrapper around a system call with the same name. Those patches
  allow older systems to use getrandom through the low-level ``syscall()``
  interface.

patches:
# Use the raw getrandom syscall only if we detect an old glibc  (@randombit)

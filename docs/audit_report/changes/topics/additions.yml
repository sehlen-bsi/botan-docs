title: Additions

description: |
  Most notable are the additions of the new random number generator based on
  the jitterentropy library as well as a new implementation of the AES using
  the VAES vector instructions.

  comment: |
    This is an integration of the jitterentropy library both as a free-standing
    RNG and an entropy source for other stateful RNGs. Jitterentropy uses CPU
    scheduling jitter as a source of entropy and relies on the system's
    high-resolution timer and was originally authored by Stephan MÃ¼ller.

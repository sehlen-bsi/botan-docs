title: New Features and Additions

description: |
  The library gained a number of new features in this revision.

  Most notably, usage of x25519+ML-KEM-768 in TLS 1.3 is now enabled by default.
  Additionally, a wrapper for the ESDM random number generator daemon and the
  byte-wise usage of the Galois-Counter-Mode-of-operation were added.

  comment: |
    The utilized inversion algorithm is (and was) implemented in constant-time,
    so blinding shouldn't be strictly necessary to begin with. This is just an
    additional countermeasure because a random blinding value is available
    and applying it is cheap.

    Support for the hybrid PQ group is now advertised by default, but for the
    sake of bandwidth efficiency it is not offered as an opportunistic key
    share. If a server is willing to negotiate the hybrid PQ group it'll have to
    send a HelloRetryRequest.

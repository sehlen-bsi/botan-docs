title: Build System

description: |
  Botan can now use the "ninja" build tool alongside "make". This is useful,
  especially on Windows, where the built-in "nmake" build tool still does not
  support parallel compilation. The security of the cryptographic
  implementations in the library is not affected by this. Another major change
  is improved multithreading support, which also does not affect security.

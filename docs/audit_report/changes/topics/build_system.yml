title: Build System

description: |
  Several minor additions and fixes to the build system. Most notably, the
  library now ships a ``botan-config.cmake`` file that allows downstream
  consumers to retire their custom ``FindBotan.cmake`` files. None of those
  patches have a direct impact on the security of the library.

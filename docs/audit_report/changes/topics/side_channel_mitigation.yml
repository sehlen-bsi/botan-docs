title: Side Channel Mitigations

description: |
  Most notably, this introduces a dedicated "value barrier" in Botan's
  constant-time helper functions to prevent the compiler from reasoning about
  possible value ranges of variables. Some compilers may introduce
  secret-dependent branches based on such reasonings as an optimization.

  On one hand, this mitigates a potential side-channel in the Kyber
  implementation that was originally reported by PQShield. On the other hand, it
  aims to prevent such compiler-introduced side channels in the rest of the code
  base.

    This introduces a new helper function aiming to prevent the compiler from
    reasoning about the value or the set of possible values of a variable.

    This mitigates a potential side-channel in the Kyber implementation where
    Clang could introduce a secret-dependant conditional branch. This was
    `found by PQShield <https://pqshield.com/pqshield-plugs-timing-leaks-in-kyber-ml-kem-to-improve-pqc-implementation-maturity>`_.

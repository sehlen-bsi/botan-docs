title: Documentation

description: |
  This contains updates to the library's documentation. Most notably, we added
  a migration guide for users coming from the now-deprecated OpenSSL 1.1.
  Additionally, we added details about the available string-based algorithm
  identifiers that are used ubiquitously throughout the library. See #3802 and #3823.

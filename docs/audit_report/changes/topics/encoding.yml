title: Encoding
description: |
  Most notably, the encoding and decoding functions for base64 and hex
  encoding and decoding have been rewritten using a constant time SWAR
  (SIMD within a register) implementation.

    Rewrite the base64 encoding and decoding functions for performance
    optimization. The new implementation uses a constant time SWAR
    approach.

    Rewrite the hex encoding and decoding functions for performance
    optimization. The new implementation uses a constant time SWAR
    approach. Also, some new convenience functions are added for SWAR and
    integrated into the new hex and base64 implementation.

title: Continuous Integration

description: |
  This contains improvements and fixes to the library's Continuous Integration
  setup. While being important for continuous functional validation, none of
  these patches have an immediate impact on the cryptographic functionality of
  Botan.

  It is worth noting that Botan now uses GitHub's CodeQL service that
  automatically scans the entire codebase for potential security
  vulnerabilities. No issues have been found at the time of this writing.

    CodeQL is a GitHub service that provides static source code analysis to
    automatically scan for vulnerabilities.

    OpenSSF Scorecards is an automated service that scans open source projects
    for a number of software security best practices. The project then receives
    a normalized score to give potential users a quick idea on the project's
    trustworthiness. Botan currently scores 9/10 in this scorecard.

title: Continuous Integration

description: |
  This section lists patches to Botan's continuous integration system.
  None of these changes are directly relevant to security. Notable is
  the addition of a self-test for the valgrind-based side channel tests.

patches:

    This self-test checks whether the automated valgrind-based side channel
    avoidance tests are working correctly for the typical secret-dependent
    execution issues found in cryptographic code.

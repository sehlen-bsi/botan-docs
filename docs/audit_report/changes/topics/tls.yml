    `RFC 8422 Section 5.11
    <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8422#section-5.11>`_ mandates that TLS
    key exchanges with X25519/X448 have to reject all-zero results. This moves
    this rejection logic into the actual key exchange algorithms, to avoid
    special case handling in TLS's key exchange logic. This became particularly
    relevant with the addition of hybrid groups, which also need to reject
    all-zero results when they contain a X25519 or X448 component.

    Those groups are emerging to be the default choice for hybrid key exchange
    on the web and are registered in the IANA TLS parameters registry.

    TLS key exchange groups based on pre-standard Kyber-r3 will be removed soon,
    given that the web community plans to move on to the ML-KEM variants as
    quickly as possible.

    Note that this will be an exception from Botan's usual semver guarantees
    where functionality or API contracts are not broken outside of a major
    version update.

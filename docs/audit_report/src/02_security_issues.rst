Security and Vulnerabilities
============================

Currently, we are not aware of any security issues that needed to be addressed
between |botan_git_base_ref| and |botan_version|.

This is a prerelease of the document, specifically to act as a preview for the
upcoming Classic McEliece implementation. It does not target a released Botan
version. Details about security vulnerabilities will be added in the final document.

**Summary**

The objective of this project is the secure implementation of a universal crypto
library that contains all common cryptographic primitives that are necessary
for the wide use of cryptographic operations. These include symmetric and
asymmetric encryption and signature methods, PRFs, hash functions, and RNGs.
Additionally, security standards such as X.509 and SSL/TLS have to be supported.
The project’s eventual goal is to add production-grade implementations of
post-quantum secure algorithms to Botan.

The library will be provided to manufacturers of VS-NfD products, which will help
the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) to evaluate these products.

This document tracks the changes and their audit results between two library
revisions. Typically audit iterations are performed starting from the previous
audit target revision to establish a new audited revision.

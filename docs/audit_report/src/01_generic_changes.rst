Changes Overview
================

This is an intermediate document revision. Most notably since the last audited
version (|botan_git_base_ref|), the TLS 1.3 implementation is now capable of
establishing secure connections using a post-quantum secure KEM and/or
user-defined Preshared Keys.

Additionally, Botan now implements KMAC -- a message authentication code based
on the Keccak permutation specified by NIST.

x25519
""""""

For the analysis of x25519, a wrapper was written that, similar to the Botan CLI, calls the functions to be analysed.
The following call is used to perform the key exchange:

.. code-block:: cpp

    const std::string kdf = "KDF2(SHA-256)";

    const Botan::Curve25519_PrivateKey key_a(rng);
    const Botan::Curve25519_PrivateKey key_b(rng);

    const auto key_a_pub = key_a.public_value();

    Botan::PK_Key_Agreement ka(key_b, rng, kdf);
    const auto shared = ka.derive_key(32, key_a_pub).bits_of();

**No leaks.**
In the first phase of the analysis with DATA, no differences occurred between the traces.
The phase one was repeated with a set of thirty key pairs.
Also the increased number of traces did not result in any differences within the execution.
This means that all tested implementations always have the same execution, regardless of the key pairs.
The second analysis phase is not necessary in this case, as no differences or points of interest were found.
Consequently, no leaks were identified.

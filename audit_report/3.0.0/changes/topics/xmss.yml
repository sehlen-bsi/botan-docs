title: "PQC: XMSS"

description: |
  The most critical changes are related to XMSS's adaptations to NIST SP.800-208.
  It defines specific parameter sets and a new WOTS key derivation. Therefore,
  the algorithm's logic changed after these adaptations. Also, a legacy support
  for versions before the NIST SP.800-208 adaptations is provided.

  Less critical changes are some architectural changes with the WOTS keys, minor
  general optimizations, test additions, and some polishing.

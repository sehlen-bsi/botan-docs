title: Minor Additions to the API or Cryptographic Features

description: |
  The changes in this section are mostly self-contained additions or
  improvements of cryptographic algorithms that cannot be associated with a
  larger feature development. Nevertheless they are relevant to the security of
  the library, in contrast to the changes in :ref:`changes/code_chores`.

    This was merged before in fa120ca3ad5dd6b3bee9750418fd9dd21380f647 but
    Jack forgot to pull before merging locally. Resulting in an inconsistent state.
    See here: https://github.com/randombit/botan/pull/2953

title: Minor Additions to the API or Cryptographic Features

description: |
  The changes in this section are mostly self-contained additions or
  improvements of cryptographic algorithms that cannot be associated with a
  larger feature development. Nevertheless they are relevant to the security of
  the library, in contrast to the changes in :ref:`changes/code_chores`.

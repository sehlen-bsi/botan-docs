title: "PQC: Dilithium"

description: |
  CRYSTALS-Dilithium was added to Botan. Additionally, some adjustments were
  made including the adaptions for the usage in X.509 certificates, test
  additions and optimizations, and general polishing. Also, there are fixes of
  minor bugs and some optimizations by precomputing and reusing values.

**Summary**

The objective of this project is the secure implementation of a
universal crypto library which contains all common cryptographic
primitives that are necessary for the wide use of cryptographic
operations. These include symmetric and asymmetric encryption and
signature methods, PRFs, hash functions and RNGs. Additionally, security
standards such as X.509 and SSL/TLS have to be supported. The library
will be provided to manufacturers of VS-NfD products which will help the
Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) to evaluate these products.

This document describes the cryptographic implementations of Botan.

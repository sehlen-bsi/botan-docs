Introduction
============

This document describes the structure and implementation of
cryptographic algorithms used in Botan. It analyzes the Botan implementations
regarding BSI recommendations [TR-02102-1]_ and [TR-02102-2]_. If the
implementation steps differ from the standard, conclusions about the standard
compliance are provided.

The following chapters cover hash functions, symmetric encryption
algorithms, message authentication codes, prime number generation,
parameter generation for public key algorithms, key generation for
public key algorithms, asymmetric encryption and key exchange schemes,
signatures, random number generators, entropy sources, X.509 path
validation and key derivation functions.
